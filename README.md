# AIRLINE RESERVATION SYSTEM USING CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEMS 
The Airline Reservation System Using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) is designed to optimize flight booking, seat allocation, and resource management for small to medium-sized airlines. By integrating CSP algorithms, the system dynamically handles constraints such as seat availability, user preferences, and flight schedules, ensuring efficient and conflict-free operations. Key features include secure user authentication using hashed passwords, real-time data processing, and a scalable database architecture built with SQLite. The system enhances booking efficiency while maintaining data integrity, providing a reliable and user-friendly solution for managing reservations, with future potential for advanced features like AI-powered recommendations and multi-airline integration.
